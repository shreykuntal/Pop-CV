# POP-CV
## Project Description
PoP-CV is a Computer Vision based Project which uses PyGame, OpenCV-Python, MediaPipe & NumPy . It is based on the concept of bursting bubbles virtually using the index finger. It's a fun based game built purely for entertainment purposes.
## First Time Setup
Please install the following libraries in python3
* opencv
* numpy
* mediapipe
* pygame
## Usage
Download the zip file of repository and extract it to Pop-CV and navigate to the repository.

Run ```pop.py``` and enjoy the game.
## Rules of the game
Player have to aim to maximize score until they run out of lives represented by hearts in upper right corner of window.

Bubbles would appear from bottom of the screen.

Bubbles should be popped by tip of index finger of any hand(both hands not to be used simultaneously).

Popping blue bubbles would give +10 score.

Popping two red bubbles or if a blue bubble cross the top of screen cost one life would cost a life.

## Conclusion
I completed this group project in which I implemented OpenCV and MediaPipe to process the video image recorded from the camera of player's device to locate the position of player's index finger and return the coordinates of the same.
